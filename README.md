## Project description :
In a world where music is ubiquitous with the democratization of technology, it is essential to create tools that meet the growing needs of users. With this in mind, our team embarked on the Spotifine project. This report details our entire process of reflection and realization. 

Our music recommendation system project revolves around the use of a database of songs we have on hand. The main objective is to simplify music discovery for our users. They will simply have to express their preferences by indicating whether or not they like a piece of music, and our system will take care of understanding their musical tastes, taking into account the emotions, themes and feelings of each piece. During the last semester, we ran a datacamp with the aim of discovering machine learning and database training. We chose to work on detecting feelings in a comment left on Amazon. To do this, we trained a database we created ourselves. We had a lot of fun doing it. We chose to work on this project because we thought it would be the most rewarding to carry out and the most educational for the future.

## I] Use and installation
Unfortunately, we were unable to deploy our site on Internet. Basically, we decided to use Azure Web Services and tried to deploy under the domain: https://spotifine.azurewebsites.net. Everything works (deployment under domain name, good parameters, ...) but the content of our files does not appear:

Nevertheless, you always have the possibility to run the main.py. It will run the Flask app and open the website localy on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. To be sure to have all the librairies installed, pip install everything in the requirements.txt
