## I] Use and installation
Unfortunately, we were unable to deploy our site on Internet. Basically, we decided to use Azure Web Services and tried to deploy under the domain: https://spotifine-dc.azurewebsites.net/. Everything works (deployment under domain name, good parameters, ...) but the content of our files does not appear:

Nevertheless, you always have the possibility to run the main.py. It will run the Flask app and open the website localy on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
